## Exchange friendship link

If you like my blog, and you also have a blog, you're welcome to email me with the following information,
and I will add your friendship link.

The following information is required:

- Your nickname.
- An image from [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) is used as your avatar.
- Describe your blog in one sentence.
- Any contact information for you.

> I'm going to have to clear dead links because dead links will cause the VitePress project to fail to build.
